    <p>All too often we hear the phrase “work-life balance” and I’ve always taken issue with this term, as really who is going to choose “work” over “life”. Instead isn’t work life blending more what we are trying to achieve? Finding a role that is fulfilling enough that work and life are seamlessly intertwined.</p>

<p>These were my musings over the last few years. But really who was I kidding? Everything changed in March 2020 when the words “pandemic” and “lockdowns” entered our daily vernacular. For those of us not on the frontlines or immediately touched by the pandemic, more time at home meant more time discovering new hobbies. By lockdown 2 and 3, the novelty had well and truly worn off. On top of that, with our colleagues and bosses armed with the knowledge that everything was closed, which meant that everyone was at home, the question seemed to be why wouldn’t we just be working?</p>

<p>If you have the privilege to manage your own time and choose when you work, then that doesn’t necessarily sound too bad. But if you are at the whim of colleagues, bosses and clients who expect you to be “on” all the time then not so much. As our living rooms took on the roles of entertainment centre, office and dining room, it became harder and harder to know when work should begin and end each day.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-a-segmenter-or-an-integrator">Are you a segmenter or an integrator?</h2>

<p>When it comes to “work-life blurring” which has been an inevitable outcome of the pandemic. We tend to fall into two camps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Integrators (those who don’t mind blurring the boundaries between work and home)</li>
  <li>Segmenters (those who like to clearly demarcate their professional and personal lives)</li>
</ol>

<p>I fall firmly into the integrator camp. I enjoy workshops, events and reading that is very much centred around tech. But segmenters truly lost out since we started working remotely.</p>

<p>The ability to create clear boundaries between work and personal life is often determined by the company culture (expectations of working over-time to get work done) and our bosses. Our direct manager plays a crucial role in the success of any flexible working. Companies have to not only trust that their employees are working effectively, but also have compassion and understanding of the human impact of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Of course, there are definitely benefits to this “work-life blurring.” We have more autonomy, more freedom and a less rigid perspective on what is work time and what isn’t.</p>

<p>A recent study in talent management consultant, Vantage Leadership refers to “work-life balance as a mental state, involving perceptions of personal success in the amount of time and energy invested into different life domains and progress toward personally meaningful goals.” There is some truth in this theory, as we can decide when we work, but all too often we are at the whim of our employers’ expectations of when work needs to be done. With the endless Zoom invites from internal and external stakeholders and clients, it becomes very difficult to balance it all.</p>

<p>There are severe consequences on both our physical and mental health, if we never have time to “switch off” or even go outside. Many days went by in January when it was simply too cold to go out in the evenings or mornings before work started. I’m sure I’m not the only one.</p>

<p>Several days in the pandemic when I logged off for the day, I couldn’t escape a sense of guilt that I should continue working. Even if all tasks have been completed, there was not always a clear way for me to punctuate the end of the work, as a daily commute would. If a work email notification pops up, while I’m watching Netflix, I’m always tempted to respond.</p>

<h2 id="if-we-are-never-really-going-to-the-old-monday-to-friday-9-5-then-how-can-we-adapt">If we are never really going to the old Monday to Friday 9-5, then how can we adapt?</h2>

<p>First off, ask team members how they work best. Where do they fall on the “segmenter” vs “integrator” scale? Secondly, realising that even in this “WFH” world we still want time to ourselves. It’s important to understand that our team mates’ working styles might be different to ours, and that’s alright. Finally, we need to normalise taking more breaks, where possible.</p>

<p>That’s why NewCo created <a href="http://10mins.org/">10mins.org</a> for when you’re in a long meeting and can feel your attention span waning. Why not regroup and pop <a href="http://10mins.org/">10mins.org</a> in the chat. For a toilet break, to make yourself of cup of tea or stretch your legs there’s <a href="http://3mins.org/">3mins.org</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s face it we’ve had enough screen time over the last year.</p>
