            "content": "When I was an intern at a bank during my undergraduate years, the task of my department was to contact other correspondent banks all over the world and enhance relationships. The job seemed complicated at first, but I managed to get a general idea in a short period of time. After six months, I was super confident and did not need to ask for help anymore from my mentor. I could even predict how many emails would be waiting for us on Mondays and I had templates of my answers already prepared. The job became repetitive and I stopped learning new skills. As a person who enjoys trying different things, I could not imagine myself being in the same repetitive cycle for multiple years. . After the experience at the bank, I started to ask myself what kind of job do I want? More importantly, what could be my dream job? What occupation makes me happy and feel proud? While I was looking for answers to these questions, I moved to the United Kingdom and opened a new chapter in my life. . Let me tell you about my academic background. I was ranked in the top 1st percentile in a very competitive nationwide university entrance exam. I decided to study Political-Science and International-Relations. I took core subjects in a four year programme, but also attended elective modules outside of my specialism. In time, I gained a good understanding of politics, economy, management, globalization, and development. They all together shaped my intellectual backbone. This means I am a social science graduate :) I know what you’re thinking, ‘wait, I was looking for a tech blog, how did I end up here?’. Don’t worry, the story begins here. . The Pandemic Made Me Consider A Different Path . Coming to a new country, adapting to a new culture, developing new habits, and cultivating a new life have been a rewarding challenge that I have undertaken for the last two years. I’ve tried many things to hold on to life tightly. I was looking for different career opportunities on this new journey. One option happened to be continuing my career in academia. I applied to several postgraduate programs in my area of interest (development studies), but the rise of COVID ended up being a turning point. Lockdowns and social distancing became a new norm in daily life, the universities in the UK announced the remote classes for the foreseeable future. . Wait! Complete postgraduate study in front of a computer screen, no thanks. It was definitely not for me. I realised I needed to find something exciting and challenging in a different way. . It’s Safe to Say, I Had Some Preconceived Notions About Tech . I am grateful that during this tumultuous time, I came across an advert for a full-stack web development bootcamp. When I was applying for the course, I had many prejudices around working in tech. Many of them came from pop culture protagonists like Mr. Robot. I imagined a tech person sitting in front of a computer in a dark, misty room of an apartment for hours without contacting anybody. Even with these biases, I decided to give it a try and went for an induction session. . I soon found answers for my questions. Now when I think about a tech person’s daily life, the lyrics of the famous song rings in my ears ‘You will never walk alone’. As a team, you take on problems, chase for solutions, ask for help, collaborate with each other, brainstorm ideas and come up with a solution. Technology grows and expands almost every single day. Everyone keeps learning, discovering and helping each other. In short, you are not a lone wolf in a wild brutal tech jungle. If you like uncertainty and spontaneity, you will definitely fall in love with the wilderness of unanswered questions in this world. I love the idea of being able to learn so much and still not knowing enough. Technology offers me hundreds of solutions for a problem and still leaves the door open for many others. Staying hungry to learn each Monday gets me really excited. . I Wasn’t Always Sure I’d Made the Right Decision . Of course it did not always go smoothly… There were ups and downs during the bootcamp. When we were learning the Javascript module, we had been assigned to complete a project with Javascript DOM methods. I had no idea how to do it and the DOM lessons were a total mess for me. Time was passing and I was struggling to move forward. Even though I had dedicated a lot of time to this topic, I barely managed to move forward. I could hear warning bells and I was overwhelmed. I wondered if I had made the right decision. I explained my miserable situation to one of my mentors and asked for help about the rest of the course. The plan was to put aside the task temporarily and focus on the next module. I took a step back and made preparations for the new class. One week later, we started to learn React JavaScript library for building user interfaces and UI components. Together with the new module, life started to become easier and I got back on track. I handle the gaps in the DOM module along the way in the course and right now it comes easily. . Following an extremely demanding yet highly satisfying one and half year within technology, I am proud to have experienced this wonderful journey that deftly fuses technical skills with soft skills. I am equipped with up to date coding tools and methods and feel I’m getting a foot in the door for my future career. While I was planning and writing this blog, I got an offer for a full time position. . Technology needs diversity and different perspectives . I believe a social science background will empower the tech person that can learn anything enthusiastically and face new challenges. This interdisciplinary educational background makes you an open-minded critical thinker. You will bring an abundance of skills and qualities that will ensure your contribution in non-technical areas of technology. . So you can support your team with those critical-analysis tools and assets. That would be tremendously helpful for the problem solving aspects of technology. . If you are looking for a new opportunity in tech and hesitant to go for it, I would definitely shout out loud: “GOOO!” .",

            "title": "What is a Portfolio Career? ",
            "content": "“Work has changed” is an understatement at this point. The last decade completely revised what society considers to be a “job.” Content creator, influencer and digital creator are no longer anomalies. Uber and TaskRabbit popularised gig work in a way that would have been unimaginable at the turn of the century. Now platforms like Fiverr, Upwork and PeoplePerHour brought freelancing to the masses. Individuals use these platforms to provide an array of services. Freelancers can be paid per task, per hour or per milestone. . These platforms elevate the most sought after freelancers with the highest star ratings. A nice idea in principle. Some can make a stable income by reaching the height of their niche, but many are commodifying themselves for profit at the expense of a steady income. . The pandemic forced many to reevaluate their work. With distributed global workforces and tools for collaboration accelerating a digital transformation that was already underway. “Follow your passion” takes on a new meaning, as creativity becomes more important in a world where technology is accelerating quicker than it ever has. A new career path came into view that allowed professionals the freedom to work on creative endeavours when they choose prompted by the passion economy. . Following in the footsteps of the gig platforms mentioned above, Podia the all-in-one digital storefront allows individuals to sell courses online. Similarly, Substack makes it simple for writers to start an email newsletter and make money from subscriptions. The top-earning writer on Substack earns more than $500,000 a year from reader subscriptions and the top creator on Podia makes more than $100,000 a month. We find ourselves at the precipice of the commoditisation of the consumer, whereby individuals “follow their passions”, build an audience and in so doing turn themselves into a business. Unlike gig work, where many are performing repeatable tasks, these individuals are much closer to entrepreneurs turning themselves into a business. . The Rise of the Portfolio Career . I know what you’re thinking. Easier said than done. But this is becoming an increasingly viable option for new entrants in the workplace. Many graduates are choosing to create their own careers by focusing on a few skills, interests and developing them. There is a rise in using the passion economy to adopt a portfolio career. We’ve gone from wanting jobs for life, to jobs for a few years, to jobs for a few weeks. Individuals are using their talents to create a career that better suits them than a traditional 9-5. However, some find themselves with multiple jobs by default, forced to top up their artistic portfolio (in a field where pay can be poor) with steadier work. . Careershifters points to three different types of portfolio careers: . Anchored: around one primary, reliable source of income; the ‘anchor’ of their career and then juggle one or more ‘satellite careers’ | Seasonal ‘different strands of their career might come into play at different times of the year’ | Part-timing ‘a mix of part-time employed work can still give you the variety and flexibility of a portfolio career’ | As a child, I was encouraged to specialise in a field and become an expert in that area. I was always reluctant to do so, as my interests were wide-ranging. It can be difficult to whittle down interests into one specialisation. In contrast, the portfolio career rewards wide achievers over high achievers, which points to a new generation of professionals willing to learn, unlearn and evolve. . The Pros and Cons of the Portfolio Career . There are many advantages to adopting a portfolio career. There is a flexibility and autonomy to focus on what you are interested in. If you are by nature entrepreneurial and driven to independently learn then this could be a good fit. We all know that sometimes jobs are not as advertised or do not necessarily allow for evolution and change. Diversifying income streams can also be more secure than a traditional job. As we saw this year, full-time employment can be a lot like being a freelance with only one client. . This type of work is definitely not for everyone. Context switching every few hours is definitely not everyone’s bag. It can also take a lot of energy at the beginning when always looking for the next opportunity or the next client. Similarly, ‘work creep’ can quite easily slip in, as it becomes even more important to have very clear boundaries around when to work. . Taking the Leap . Before reinventing how you work there are a few things to consider. What is your financial risk threshold? Do you have enough connections to steadily maintain opportunities? What skills are you looking to leverage in the first instance? Are you going to take a phased approach or go all in from the start? . Since lockdown began the number of new companies formed in the U.K. and U.S. was up 40% versus a year earlier, and most of those new companies were portfolio professionals. According to the ONS, there are over 5 million self-employed people in the UK working in a wide-variety of industries. This figure will only grow over time as more platforms for creative endeavours are created and as the pandemic has changed what we look to get out of our work. . If you want to test the possibilities of a portfolio career, a great place to start is on NewCo. NewCo is a place to work on each others’ startup ideas. It’s built for diverse teams from all over the world. Coming this summer to Android and iOS. ⁠ .",

            "content": "There was once a man named Frederick Taylor. 100 years ago he embarked on a scientific quest for perfect workplace efficiency—Taylorism: . “There is not a single worker”, Taylor would repeat, “who does not devote a considerable part of his time to studying just how slowly he can work and still convince his employer that he is going at a good pace”. . The man was a maniac, he would creep up behind you with a stopwatch and time your personal conversations. In an age of empire and eugenics, Taylor saw workers as inefficient machines made of meat and insubordination. . No more stopwatches . The stopwatch was a false economy, of course it was. As knowledge work became more enlightened we saw that the best teams were built around trust and the best leaders were the emotionally intelligent, empathetic ones. People who wanted to be there, working with others who wanted to be there too. . We dismantled unnecessary hierarchy and assumed trust in the nick of time. March 2020, a pandemic descended and we withdrew into our bunkers. . Remote . When the rolls of toilet paper returned to the shelves and we’d calculated ‘the curve’—when it became clear that society wasn’t poised to crumble—we turned our focus to the most consequential of side effects: the greatest professional experiment in history. . “Who led your Digital Transformation? CEO, CTO or COVID-19” we laughed and rolled our eyes. “A decade of progress in just a few short months”. Our adaptability was lauded against the bleak backdrop of loss and policymaking. . Our data told us that remote efficiency was improved for solo tasks and impaired for collaborative tasks or something to that effect and we rearranged our ceremonies to compensate. In the battle for remote video bandwidth, Zoom won the verb but commoditisation won the war. We split ourselves into camera-on people vs camera-off people and then again into integrators vs segmenters. We adapted like we always do. “You’re on mute I think”. What’s to think? Look at the red icon. . We lamented the untold hours of cumulative commuting from the before-times. Cattle trains. Why did we ever bother? “I don’t know if I’ll even go back to London” sung with a cheery shrug as the waves crash against the Cornish coast outside the window below. And why would you go back, but for the whistle of ‘London salaries’ and the ominous refrain of the global local workforce: . If your job can be outsourced to Cornwall it can be outsourced to Bangalore. . Do you miss the office? . Unremote . A lot of people who miss the office have now said goodbye forever. Not everybody will be invited back. For many, the next few years will be a slow farewell; death by a thousand lapsed leases. . The office itself will be reborn. The serendipitous interactions and the decades of architectural design that enabled them will continue to flourish. The spaces will be beautifully adapted to our new needs. . But not for all of us. Offices are expensive and we’ve proven that we don’t need them. They will become a perk, a luxury. The writing is on all four walls, the office will be a place that you are promoted into. The friendship and bonds born at the office will be sacrifices we won’t realise we’re being asked to make until it’s too late. The impact seems less apparent to us, locked down here in 2021, acclimated to the isolation and detached from the memory of physical communal spaces. The immeasurable power they have to foster love and community. . We’ll mourn them when they’re gone. . And so when the employer surveys circulate asking how you feel about the new normal and your preferences for the future of work, think very carefully before you tick the box marked ‘remote only’. . It’s a box that might stay ticked forever. . . NewCo is based at Somerset House in London. .",

            "title": "Take a Break",
            "content": "All too often we hear the phrase “work-life balance” and I’ve always taken issue with this term, as really who is going to choose “work” over “life”. Instead isn’t work life blending more what we are trying to achieve? Finding a role that is fulfilling enough that work and life are seamlessly intertwined. . These were my musings over the last few years. But really who was I kidding? Everything changed in March 2020 when the words “pandemic” and “lockdowns” entered our daily vernacular. For those of us not on the frontlines or immediately touched by the pandemic, more time at home meant more time discovering new hobbies. By lockdown 2 and 3, the novelty had well and truly worn off. On top of that, with our colleagues and bosses armed with the knowledge that everything was closed, which meant that everyone was at home, the question seemed to be why wouldn’t we just be working? . If you have the privilege to manage your own time and choose when you work, then that doesn’t necessarily sound too bad. But if you are at the whim of colleagues, bosses and clients who expect you to be “on” all the time then not so much. As our living rooms took on the roles of entertainment centre, office and dining room, it became harder and harder to know when work should begin and end each day. . Are you a segmenter or an integrator? . When it comes to “work-life blurring” which has been an inevitable outcome of the pandemic. We tend to fall into two camps: . Integrators (those who don’t mind blurring the boundaries between work and home) | Segmenters (those who like to clearly demarcate their professional and personal lives) | I fall firmly into the integrator camp. I enjoy workshops, events and reading that is very much centred around tech. But segmenters truly lost out since we started working remotely. . The ability to create clear boundaries between work and personal life is often determined by the company culture (expectations of working over-time to get work done) and our bosses. Our direct manager plays a crucial role in the success of any flexible working. Companies have to not only trust that their employees are working effectively, but also have compassion and understanding of the human impact of the pandemic. . Of course, there are definitely benefits to this “work-life blurring.” We have more autonomy, more freedom and a less rigid perspective on what is work time and what isn’t. . A recent study in talent management consultant, Vantage Leadership refers to “work-life balance as a mental state, involving perceptions of personal success in the amount of time and energy invested into different life domains and progress toward personally meaningful goals.” There is some truth in this theory, as we can decide when we work, but all too often we are at the whim of our employers’ expectations of when work needs to be done. With the endless Zoom invites from internal and external stakeholders and clients, it becomes very difficult to balance it all. . There are severe consequences on both our physical and mental health, if we never have time to “switch off” or even go outside. Many days went by in January when it was simply too cold to go out in the evenings or mornings before work started. I’m sure I’m not the only one. . Several days in the pandemic when I logged off for the day, I couldn’t escape a sense of guilt that I should continue working. Even if all tasks have been completed, there was not always a clear way for me to punctuate the end of the work, as a daily commute would. If a work email notification pops up, while I’m watching Netflix, I’m always tempted to respond. . If we are never really going to the old Monday to Friday 9-5, then how can we adapt? . First off, ask team members how they work best. Where do they fall on the “segmenter” vs “integrator” scale? Secondly, realising that even in this “WFH” world we still want time to ourselves. It’s important to understand that our team mates’ working styles might be different to ours, and that’s alright. Finally, we need to normalise taking more breaks, where possible. . That’s why NewCo created 10mins.org for when you’re in a long meeting and can feel your attention span waning. Why not regroup and pop 10mins.org in the chat. For a toilet break, to make yourself of cup of tea or stretch your legs there’s 3mins.org. . Let’s face it we’ve had enough screen time over the last year. . By Naima Camara (COO &amp; Founder) .
