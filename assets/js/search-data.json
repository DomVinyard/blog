            "content": ". There was once a man named Frederick Taylor. 100 years ago he embarked on a scientific quest for perfect workplace efficiency—Taylorism: . ”There is not a single worker”, Taylor would repeat, “who does not devote a considerable part of his time to studying just how slowly he can work and still convince his employer that he is going at a good pace”. . The man was a maniac, he would creep up behind you with a stopwatch and time your personal conversations. In an age of empire and eugenics, Taylor saw workers as inefficient machines made of meat and insubordination. . No more stopwatches . The stopwatch was a false economy, of course it was. As knowledge work became more enlightened we saw that the best teams were built around trust and the best leaders were the emotionally intelligent, empathetic ones. People who wanted to be there, working with others who wanted to be there too. . We dismantled unnecessary hierarchy and assumed trust in the nick of time. March 2020, a pandemic descended and we withdrew into our bunkers. . Remote . When the rolls of toilet paper returned to the shelves and we’d calculated ‘the curve’—when it became clear that society wasn’t poised to crumble—we turned our focus to the most consequential of side effects: the greatest professional experiment in history. . “Who led your Digital Transformation? CEO, CTO or COVID-19” we laughed and rolled our eyes. “A decade of progress in just a few short months”. Our adaptability was lauded against the bleak backdrop of loss and policymaking. . Our data told us that remote efficiency was improved for solo tasks and impaired for collaborative tasks or something to that effect and we rearranged our ceremonies to compensate. In the battle for remote video bandwidth, Zoom won the verb but commoditisation won the war. We split ourselves into camera-on people vs camera-off people and then again into integrators vs segmenters. We adapted like we always do. “You’re on mute I think”. What’s to think? Look at the red icon. . We lamented the untold hours of cumulative commuting from the before-times. Cattle trains. Why did we ever bother? “I don’t know if I’ll even go back to London” sung with a cheery shrug as the waves crash against the Cornish coast outside the window below. And why would you go back, but for the whistle of ‘London salaries’ and the ominous refrain of the global local workforce: . If your job can be outsourced to Cornwall it can be outsourced to Bangalore. . Do you miss the office? . Unremote . A lot of people who miss the office have now said goodbye forever. Not everybody will be invited back. For many, the next few years will be a slow farewell; death by a thousand lapsed leases. . The office space itself will be reborn. The serendipitous interactions and the decades of architectural design that enabled them will continue to flourish. The spaces will be beautifully adapted to our new needs. . But not for all of us. Offices are expensive and we’ve proven that we don’t need them. They will become a perk, a luxury. The writing is on all four walls, the office will be a place that you are promoted into. The friendship and bonds born at the office will be sacrifices we won’t realise we’re being asked to make until it’s too late. The impact seems less apparent to us, locked down here in 2021, acclimated to the isolation and detached from the memory of physical communal spaces. The immeasurable power they have to foster love and community. . We’ll mourn them when they’re gone. . And so when the employer surveys circulate asking how you feel about the new normal and your preferences for the future of work, think very carefully before you tick the box marked ‘remote only’. . It’s a box that might stay ticked forever. . . NewCo is based at Somerset House in London. .",

            "title": "Take a Break",
            "content": ". All too often we hear the phrase “work-life balance” and I’ve always taken issue with this term, as really who is going to choose “work” over “life”. Instead isn’t work life blending more what we are trying to achieve? Finding a role that is fulfilling enough that work and life are seamlessly intertwined. . These were my musings over the last few years. But really who was I kidding? Everything changed in March 2020 when the words “pandemic” and “lockdowns” entered our daily vernacular. For those of us not on the frontlines or immediately touched by the pandemic, more time at home meant more time discovering new hobbies. By lockdown 2 and 3, the novelty had well and truly worn off. On top of that, with our colleagues and bosses armed with the knowledge that everything was closed, which meant that everyone was at home, the question seemed to be why wouldn’t we just be working? . If you have the privilege to manage your own time and choose when you work, then that doesn’t necessarily sound too bad. But if you are at the whim of colleagues, bosses and clients who expect you to be “on” all the time then not so much. As our living rooms took on the roles of entertainment centre, office and dining room, it became harder and harder to know when work should begin and end each day. . Are you a segmenter or an integrator? . When it comes to “work-life blurring” which has been an inevitable outcome of the pandemic. We tend to fall into two camps: . Integrators (those who don’t mind blurring the boundaries between work and home) | Segmenters (those who like to clearly demarcate their professional and personal lives) | I fall firmly into the integrator camp. I enjoy workshops, events and reading that is very much centred around tech. But segmenters truly lost out since we started working remotely. . The ability to create clear boundaries between work and personal life is often determined by the company culture (expectations of working over-time to get work done) and our bosses. Our direct manager plays a crucial role in the success of any flexible working. Companies have to not only trust that their employees are working effectively, but also have compassion and understanding of the human impact of the pandemic. . Of course, there are definitely benefits to this “work-life blurring.” We have more autonomy, more freedom and a less rigid perspective on what is work time and what isn’t. . A recent study in talent management consultant, Vantage Leadership refers to “work-life balance as a mental state, involving perceptions of personal success in the amount of time and energy invested into different life domains and progress toward personally meaningful goals.” There is some truth in this theory, as we can decide when we work, but all too often we are at the whim of our employers’ expectations of when work needs to be done. With the endless Zoom invites from internal and external stakeholders and clients, it becomes very difficult to balance it all. . There are severe consequences on both our physical and mental health, if we never have time to “switch off” or even go outside. Many days went by in January when it was simply too cold to go out in the evenings or mornings before work started. I’m sure I’m not the only one. . Several days in the pandemic when I logged off for the day, I couldn’t escape a sense of guilt that I should continue working. Even if all tasks have been completed, there was not always a clear way for me to punctuate the end of the work, as a daily commute would. If a work email notification pops up, while I’m watching Netflix, I’m always tempted to respond. . If we are never really going to the old Monday to Friday 9-5, then how can we adapt? . First off, ask team members how they work best. Where do they fall on the “segmenter” vs “integrator” scale? Secondly, realising that even in this “WFH” world we still want time to ourselves. It’s important to understand that our team mates’ working styles might be different to ours, and that’s alright. Finally, we need to normalise taking more breaks, where possible. . That’s why NewCo created 10mins.org for when you’re in a long meeting and can feel your attention span waning. Why not regroup and pop 10mins.org in the chat. For a toilet break, to make yourself of cup of tea or stretch your legs there’s 3mins.org. . Let’s face it we’ve had enough screen time over the last year. . By Naima Camara (COO &amp; Founder) .
