    <p>We‚Äôve been stuck inside a lot this past year. Hours spent staring blankly out the window, the ever-deepening claustrophobia as the seasons came and fled. So it was, one evening in lockdown, I set out to answer a fundamental question:</p>

<p>Who invented ‚Äòinside‚Äô?</p>

<p>Of course, we could take inspiration from the animal kingdom. Animals that burrow have an <em>inside</em> (inside the burrow). Bees have an <em>inside</em> (inside the hive). Humans though, we don‚Äôt burrow and we don‚Äôt build hives to the very best of my knowledge. Presumably there was once a time before we had an inside to get locked-down in.</p>

<p>The first <em>human house</em> dates to about 400,000 years ago. Around that time, someone in France <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/hearths-shelters/terra-amata-shelter">built themselves a house</a>. Now, it wasn‚Äôt called France then, and it wasn‚Äôt called a house, but that‚Äôs distinctly what it was. It had supports and foundations and a fire in the middle. The image at the top of this article is an artist‚Äôs reconstruction.</p>

<p>We can go back further. Humans are descended from a species called Homo Erectus. They were pretty great really, anatomically similar to us, skilled with stone tools, and we‚Äôve found <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/662794.stm">one of their houses</a> in Japan. It‚Äôs not quite as solid as the one in France but the post-holes are well dug.</p>

<p><em>Inside</em> is therefore a technology that we inherited from our ancestors. John Rick, Archeologist from Stanford tells us this about Homo Erectus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They had the idea of actually making a structure, a place where you might sleep. It represents a conceptual division between inside and outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before that there is some doubt, 1.8 million years ago lived a woman called <a href="http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/origins/australopithecus_afarensis.php">Lucy</a>. She was hairier than us, shorter arms and legs, but still distinctly more human than chimp. She had a few stone tools but they were pretty basic. In Tanzania, where Lucy and her friends lived, they found a stone circle about 12m¬≤ (about the size of the average bedroom today). Not all archaeologists are convinced it‚Äôs evidence of a house, it might just be a rock formation.</p>

<p>Anyway, we‚Äôre not looking for the first house, we‚Äôre looking for the first <em>inside,</em> and if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD36ZhpHPpE">Captain Caveman</a> has taught us anything then we really need to consider caves. Why build a house if nature is on hand to provide one? Here we can go back even further. At least two <em>million</em> years, to our ancestors ancestor <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081219172137.htm">Homo Habilis</a>. Habilis was short (about 3 and a half feet) and he loved meat, he couldn‚Äôt get enough meat. They lived in groups of 70-80 people and we‚Äôve found a cave in South Africa where they slept and carved up their meat.</p>

<p>Inside.</p>

<p>If only they could see us now.</p>

<p>Before we wandered into the caves we slept out on the plains and before the plains we slept up in the trees, in nests. Before we evolved into <em>hominids at all</em> we were these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiadapis">weird cat things</a> and they weren‚Äôt building houses for shit.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that we‚Äôll likely never know who invented <em>inside,</em> the very first thinker to imagine a life not entirely outdoors. And yet, while that moment of discovery will remain lost to prehistory, I have a distinct feeling they would‚Äôve recognised the significance of their innovation at the time. In joining those dots, imagining that future, they‚Äôd have known they were doing something remarkable. It‚Äôs an odd thing to do, to salute someone from the other side of a 2 million year stretch but that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll end.</p>

<p>Thank you, prehistoric innovator, for helping us stay safe this past year. üçª</p>
