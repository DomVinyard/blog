> Mahmut is a Junior Software developer here at NewCo and this is his debut blog. He's been playing a key role in getting the app ready for launch next month!

When I was an intern at a bank during my undergraduate years, the task of my department was to contact other correspondent banks all over the world and enhance relationships. The job seemed complicated at first, but I managed to get a general idea in a short period of time. After six months, I was super confident and did not need to ask for help anymore from my mentor. I could even predict how many emails would be waiting for us on Mondays and I had templates of my answers already prepared. The job became repetitive and I stopped learning new skills. As a person who enjoys trying different things, I could not imagine myself being in the same repetitive cycle for multiple years.

After the experience at the bank, I started to ask myself what kind of job do I want? More importantly, what could be my dream job? What occupation makes me happy and feel proud? While I was looking for answers to these questions, I moved to the United Kingdom and opened a new chapter in my life.

Let me tell you about my academic background. I was ranked in the top 1st percentile in a very competitive nationwide university entrance exam. I decided to study Political-Science and International-Relations. I took core subjects in a four year programme, but also attended elective modules outside of my specialism. In time, I gained a good understanding of politics, economy, management, globalization, and development. They all together shaped my intellectual backbone. This means I am a social science graduate :) I know what you’re thinking, ‘wait, I was looking for a tech blog, how did I end up here?’. Don't worry, the story begins here.

**The Pandemic Made Me Consider A Different Path**

Coming to a new country, adapting to a new culture, developing new habits, and cultivating a new life have been a rewarding challenge that I have undertaken for the last two years. I’ve tried many things to hold on to life tightly. I was looking for different career opportunities on this new journey. One option happened to be continuing my career in academia. I applied to several postgraduate programs in my area of interest (development studies), but the rise of COVID ended up being a turning point. Lockdowns and social distancing became a new norm in daily life, the universities in the UK announced the remote classes for the foreseeable future.

Wait! Complete postgraduate study in front of a computer screen, no thanks. It was definitely not for me. I realised I needed to find something exciting and challenging in a different way.

**It’s Safe to Say, I Had Some Preconceived Notions About Tech**

I am grateful that during this tumultuous time, I came across an advert for a full-stack web development bootcamp. When I was applying for the course, I had many prejudices around working in tech. Many of them came from pop culture protagonists like [Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/). I imagined a tech person sitting in front of a computer in a dark, misty room of an apartment for hours without contacting anybody. Even with these biases, I decided to give it a try and went for an induction session.

I soon found answers for my questions. Now when I think about a tech person’s daily life, the lyrics of the famous song rings in my ears ‘You will never walk alone’. As a team, you take on problems, chase for solutions, ask for help, collaborate with each other, brainstorm ideas and come up with a solution. Technology grows and expands almost every single day. Everyone keeps learning, discovering and helping each other. In short, you are not a lone wolf in a wild brutal tech jungle. If you like uncertainty and spontaneity, you will definitely fall in love with the wilderness of unanswered questions in this world. I love the idea of being able to learn so much and still not knowing enough. Technology offers me hundreds of solutions for a problem and still leaves the door open for many others. Staying hungry to learn each Monday gets me really excited.

**I Wasn’t Always Sure I’d Made the Right Decision**

Of course it did not always go smoothly.. There were ups and downs during the bootcamp. When we were learning the Javascript module, we had been assigned to complete a project with Javascript DOM methods. I had no idea how to do it and the DOM lessons were a total mess for me. Time was passing and I was struggling to move forward. Even though I had dedicated a lot of time to this topic, I barely managed to move forward. I could hear warning bells and I was overwhelmed. I wondered if I had made the right decision. I explained my miserable situation to one of my mentors and asked for help about the rest of the course. The plan was to put aside the task temporarily and focus on the next module. I took a step back and made preparations for the new class. One week later, we started to learn React JavaScript library for building user interfaces and UI components. Together with the new module, life started to become easier and I got back on track. I handle the gaps in the DOM module along the way in the course and right now it comes easily.

Following an extremely demanding yet highly satisfying one and half year within technology, I am proud to have experienced this wonderful journey that deftly fuses technical skills with soft skills. I am equipped with up to date coding tools and methods and feel I'm getting a foot in the door for my future career. While I was planning and writing this blog, I got an offer for a full time position.

**Technology needs diversity and different perspectives**

I believe a social _science_ background will empower the tech person that can learn anything enthusiastically and face new challenges. This interdisciplinary educational background makes you an open-minded critical thinker. You will bring an abundance of [skills and qualities](http://bbc.com/worklife/article/20190401-why-worthless-humanities-degrees-may-set-you-up-for-life) that will ensure your contribution in non-technical areas of technology.

So you can support your team with those critical-analysis tools and assets. That would be tremendously helpful for the problem solving aspects of technology.

If you are looking for a new opportunity in tech and hesitant to go for it, I would definitely shout out loud: “GO!”
